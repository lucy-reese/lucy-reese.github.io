    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>I grew up as a military kid, so I have moved a lot and had the opportunity to live overseas twice (specifically South Korea and Japan). As a byproduct of my upbringing, I love to travel internationally as well as within the country to visit friends I've made growing up. Other hobbies I have include reading mystery novels, running in the great Colorado outdoors, and watching Marvel movies.</h3>
