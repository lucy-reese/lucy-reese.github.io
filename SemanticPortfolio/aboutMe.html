    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I grew up as a military kid, so I moved frequently during my childhood, having the opportunity to live in locations such as the frosty interior of Alaska, outside the bustling cityscape of Japan, and everywhere in between. 
    As a byproduct of my upbringing, I love to travel internationally as well as within the country to visit friends I've made growing up. 
    Other hobbies I have include reading mystery novels, running in the great Colorado outdoors, and watching Marvel movies.</p>
