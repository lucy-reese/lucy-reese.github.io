        <p><strong>Potted Security:</strong> A secure contraption to keep your valuables hidden in plain sight.</p>
        <p>This project was made to solve my personal pet peeve of not having a lockbox for my valuables. 
        As a poor college student, I cannot financially afford a large enough lockbox (which costs upwards of $150)
        to keep important documents and electronics secure. With my Arduino kit and a little creativity, I found 
        I could make a more affordable and inventive strongbox. I took this project a step further and made the 
        lockbox appear to be a houseplant to further disguise the true purpose of this contraption.</p>
